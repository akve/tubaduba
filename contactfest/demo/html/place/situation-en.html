<p>We have decided to write this paragraph for those who want to know more about the current atmosphere and political situation in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Sadly the conflict is still ongoing, but the good thing is that it remains within a little area far in the east of Ukraine. One thousand kilometers separate our retreat center near Kiev from the zone of conflict – it’s quite a distance, big enough to fit in a few more countries.</p>
<p>In a meantime a number of good changes have been noticed in the country: more and more people initiate new cultural projects, independent associations aiming to raise the general cultural level of the country become more present. Public views become more open, more interest is being directed towards things that used to be ignored by the society. And this inspires to move further, in particular, to promote here the contact improvisation as dance, practice and embodied metaphor of nonviolent communication.</p>
