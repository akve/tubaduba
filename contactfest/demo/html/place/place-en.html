<h2>Venue</h2>
<br>
<p>This time we said NO to cities and long transitions between studios.. and went looking for an amiable place to dance in the nature. Where we could be together from the beginning till the end. To spend more time together and to do more dancing.. 

<p>We found a wonderful place in the heart of history of Ukraine, near the bank of Dnipro river, the Ganga of of the Ukraine. There is a also a comfortable sport camp with welcoming hosts. The center has several incredible spaces for long lasting, spacious and meditative jams.</p>
