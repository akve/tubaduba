	<h3>CI in the water workshop: "Me, you and water"</h3>
	<h5>Level: intermediate</h5>
	Everything is different when in water, and rules we got used to don't work there. There is almost no weight and friction. We are in a dance and constantly moving media. If we are in a hurry, we waste a lot of energy fighting against water. But if we are patient - water helps and supports us. Water teaches us to be sencere, delicate and smooth.
	<p>During the workshop we are going to play with different qualities of water and different qualities of us when interacting in a water. We will be seeking the way to transfer Contact Improvisation to the water. And, for sure, we will find something new for our dance on land. I hope my experience in teching Watsu and CI will help our exploration to be even more interesting and fruitfull.
	<p>As the first part of each class, there will be a group exploration of different technics and skills. The second part - dancing in a water.

	<p>/As workshop material will be consistent, would be nice to have the same group during all five days of the intensive.   Because of the pool size we can only invite 20 participants./

		<p><b>Yuri Lvov</b></p>
		Contact improviser and specialist in water body-oriented practices (Watsu). Studied CI and Watsu in Russia, US, Europe and Israel. 

		<p>â€œPracticing CI changed my life completely. CI constantly expands my possibilities, and acts as a source of enormous amount of revelations. Due to it, my world became much more vivid, clear and tasty. 

		<p>And at the moment I met Watsu, earth and water mixed happily in my life. From CI i bring to water practices the dance and joy of interaction. And from water I take trust, balance and flow. In this training, I want to co-explore such ideas and questions, as: source of motion, listening and hearing to yourself/partner, lightness, and openness to something new.
