	<h3>"Gaga"</h3>
	<br>
	<p>The Gaga movement language originated from the belief in the healing, dynamic, ever-changing power of movement, developed by Batsheva Dance Company's artistic director Ohad Naharin. The method offers a framework for discovering and strengthening the body, for challenging our movement habits and exploring the endless possibilities in a gentle way while lightning our senses and imagination.</p>
	<p>The work improves instinctive movement and enhances the ability to use our energy for engaging our explosive power within a wide range of different textures and qualities. </p>
	<p>Gaga offers an experience of freedom and pleasure, each one with himself together with others. </p>
	<p>"We connect to the sense of the endlessness of possibilities. We explore multi-dimensional movement, we enjoy the burning sensation in our muscles, we are ready to snap, we are aware of our explosive power, and sometimes we use it. We change our movement habits by finding new ones. We go beyond our familiar limits. We become calm and alert at once." — <i>Ohad Naharin</i></p>
