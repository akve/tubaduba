	<h3>"BODY LANGUAGES"</h3><br>
	
	<p>Class for beginners and advanced (principles day).</p>

	<p>We all come from different places, we all have our habits, our different languages. Yet we can communicate through the dance with all our being, our bodies, and with all our qualities and our emotions, despite our differences and our peculiar features. To do this, we have at our disposal a wide repertoire as: technical physical movements, emotions and feelings, life stories, games and humor, philosophical discussions, poetry, and of course some styles of contact-danse, etc ...</p>
	<p>What is the specificity repertoire of your body expressions? In this workshop, we are going to look for communication through our own choices, our collective choices and with a particular partner.</p>

	<p>What are our methods to express what we are and to find our collective way through the environment around us? We will try to elucidate some pieces of this issue by means of personal movement, contact improvisation and group improvisation.
