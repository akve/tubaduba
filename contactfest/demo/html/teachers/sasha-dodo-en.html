	<h3>"DANCE OF NOT-KNOWING"</h3><br>
	
	<p>Dancing not-knowing I find myself in a place I've never been.</p>
	<p>Not-knowing is often avoided by moving away from a present moment to the familiar circumstances, to the past experience, desires and goals. It is not necessary to focus only on things we know, it limits our dance and our live. Each and everyone chooses for himself what is dance and what one needs to fully enjoy it. We do not have to decide. It is not necessary to define, to limit the dance in order to dance. </p>
	<p>It would be very nice if the platform for our dance was not-knowing. So the original depth could be preserved regardless of the forms, learned tricks and mastered techniques.</p>
	<p>When there is depth, learning different techniques runs efficiently, a new experience is integrated into the body easier, without unnecessary stress and with a clear link to what is happening.</p>
	<p>When we dance there maybe no goal to be like someone, be better than someone. </p>
	<p>We can see how much our dance changes when familiar guidelines are lost. We can orient on what is happening in the present moment, not following our desires. We can continuously remain in not-knowing together, not-doing, but be present, observing how one flows into the other, how dance dancing itself from inside of us. Seeing the dance for what it is and not as we used to see it.</p>
	<p>Not-knowing is an environment, staying in it - changes us, we become broader and deeper, go beyond the usual boundaries, it is immediately reflected in the quality of movement, interaction with the partner and space. All becomes not so straightforward, becomes ever-changing, fresh and unpredictable.</p>
	<p>Consciously or unconsciously our body already knows a lot about how you should act in a given situation. It actually shows us our past experience in each dance.
