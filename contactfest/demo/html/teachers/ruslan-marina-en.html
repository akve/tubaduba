	<h3>"Poetry of simple things"</h3>
	<h5>Level: beginners and up</h5><br>
	
	<p>Once, pretty long time ago, I read a phrase by Danny Lepkoff: "Dancing CI in a simple way - that's a talent". And these words still inspire me. To see the beauty in simple things, do not over-complicate, easily accept and let go, feel satisfied with small, but aim for bigger, find interest in what's happening, enjoy the details, find the comfort zone. And enjoy simple moments in our dances. That's what we'd love to focus on our classes. </p>
