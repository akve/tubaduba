	<p>
	The Gaga movement language, developed by  Batsheva Dance Company's artistic director  Ohad Naharin, originated from the belief in the healing, dynamic, ever-changing power of movement. The method offers a framework for discovering and strengthening the body, for challenging our movement habits and exploring the endless possibilities in a gentle way, while lightening our senses and imagination. Gaga offers an experience of freedom and pleasure, each one with himself and with others.

	 <i>"We connect to the sense of the endlessness of possibilities. Yielding is constant while we are ready to snap... We explore multi-dimensional movement, we enjoy the burning sensation in our muscles, we are aware of our explosive power and sometimes we use it. We change our movement habits by finding new ones, we can be calm and alert at once. We become available . . .”</i>  -  Ohad Naharin</p>
