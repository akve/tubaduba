	<h3>Contact as an Act of Resistance</h3>
	<h5>Level: advanced</h5>
	<br>
	<p>
This Contact Improvisation intensive will focus on developing an open system Contact Body that increases possibilities and cultivates radical aliveness. We will experiment with a multiplicity of ways to take our humanness in and out of physical contact and notice what that does to our evolving definition/experience of Contact Improvisation. We will practice endurance, permeability, durability, vulnerability, nuance, and intelligence. Through highlighting and accessing specificity within physical and energetic spatial pathways we will increase our aesthetic and sensorial range. 
<p>We will question, provoke, and tangle with aspects of identity, power, expectations, composition, and communication. We will work to find agency in everything we do. We will set boundaries, take risks, and sweat. The politics of responsive resistance will offer a framework for inquiry, transgression, and generosity within our dancing. It is a high stakes and high physicality proposition. Some of the research will be quite practical and some will be quite elusive. We will consider why and how our dancing is relevant in the current world. It is an ‘all in all the time’ intensive that is designed for experienced dancers.

		<p><b>Bio:</b></p>
		<p>Anya Cloud (US). I dance with the body that I have to cultivate radical aliveness, longevity, and possibility. Originally from Alaska, I am currently based in San Diego, California. Contact Improvisation, through teaching, practice, and performance, is a central aspect of my work as a contemporary dance artist. I teach Contact Improvisation at universities, in the community and at festivals including having taught at Tanzquartier, Freiburg Contact Festival, Contact Austria, Israeli Contact Improvisation Festival,  Ibiza Contact Festival, wcciJAM, Salt Dance Fest, and SFDI. 
<br><br>
			I am in ongoing practice/facilitation of the Underscore and recently collaborated with Nancy Stark Smith and others as part of the GLIMPSE project. As a dancer and dance maker I have worked with and/or performed for Sara Shelton Mann, Nancy Stark Smith, Ishmael Houston-Jones, Karen Nelson, Eric Geiger, Karen Schaffman, Yolande Snaith, Leslie Seiters, Sabine Parzer, and Kristianne Salcines among others. My ongoing work in collaboration with Sara Shelton Mann profoundly impacts my artistry. In 2013 I received my MFA in Dance Theatre from UC San Diego. I currently teach in Dance Studies at California State University San Marcos, as well as co-directing PADL West (a non-profit dance presenting organization). </p>
