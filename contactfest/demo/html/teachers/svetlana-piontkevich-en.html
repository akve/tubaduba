	<p>The class will consist of two parts.

In the first part we will explore moving from the center towards the periphery and in reverse, building support and practicing principals of falling.

And in the second part we will look into different instruments of improvisation, creativity, and how to make our dance interesting not only for ourselves but also for others.</p>
