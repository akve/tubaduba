	<h3>"The Practice of Flow and Contact"</h3>
	<br>
	<p>The Practice of Flow - FloWork - is a movement awareness practice based on principles from Aikido, Ilan Lev Method and Contact Improvisation.</p>
	<p>I wish to offer tools to enrich the combination of free movement and strong structure, a combination that, by nature, already exists around and inside us. Through the practice, we will find ways to use the skeleton to carry weight, while releasing unnecessary muscular effort, which may help to support the flow, sensing the movement and letting us stay available, grounded and free. During our meetings we will explore these qualities individually and later on with a partner, bringing these principles into the dance with another body, into the practice of Contact Improvisation.</p>

		<p><b>Bio:</b></p>
		<p>During my childhood I enjoyed to explore my physicality in the nature and in sports, but I never had the courage to dance.</p>
		<p>Finally, at the age of 30 I began to dance, with a main focus on Improvisation and Contact improvisation, as well as Aikido and later on the Ilan Lev Method.</p>
		<p>After few years of working as an architect, I chose to fully devote myself to the path of movement. Along the years I continue to dive deeper in to the exploration of movement, body and dance, and I enjoy the benefits and inspiration it brings to my life.</p>
		<p>Today, alongside giving treatments, teaching and performing, I am managing the "Israeli C.I Association" and co manager at "TENA" Studio and The Body Research  program. As well previous co-manager of the Ilan Lev Body Work Method.</p>
