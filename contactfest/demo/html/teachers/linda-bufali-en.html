	<h3>"BETWEEN GAP AND TOUCH"</h3>
	<br>
	<p>Empty spaces, to be followed, to be filled, to be live in.</p>
	<p>We will observe volumes, the spaces that get constantly created between us and the other.</p>
	<p>The contact will arrive without forcing it, unexpected and loose of an "esthetical form".</p>
	<p>What is possible to be controlled and what is not? <br>When can I choose? When, in the other hand, is not possible and I have to trust to follow, to flow, to fall?<br>We will use very simple images to experience the concept of fullness / emptiness and what is in the middle. We will push to the exteme many 'roles' that we can choose during the dance and that we can change all the time, looking for an internal stimulus that travels  from us to partner and to the space.</p>
	<p>Technically it is a proposal on the tone, on the load of movement and connection, to enrich and enjoy every moment what's in the duo.</p>
	<p>When working in solo, we will use the image of the ball to dance the internal and external space of our body, to dance with the floor, to play with moments of disequilibrium to exit from our usual 'frontal pattern', discovering the endless directions. Weight, momentum, listening, spirals.</p>
	<p>And we'll dance.</p>

		<p><b>Bio:</b></p>
		<p>While I was trying to study acting, in 1998, l bumped intoâ€¦and against this "weird dance". After few years I realized I was still there, sweating, falling, laughing and feeling. So I decided to go deeper into it, entering the phantasmagorical world of workshops and festivals, bumping into and against strange teachers who helped me sweating, falling , laughing and feeling even better. <br>I'd give anything to forget all that so to start again, off for the journey again! But it's not possible.</p>
		<p>Since 2008, I have been teaching in Italy (intensive workshops in many communities and Italy Contact Festival '15), abroad (intensive workshop in Madrid, Lleida, Alcoi, Colon, Basque Country and Israeli Contact Festival '14) and I have been organising events to help Contact Improvisation spread as much as possible (I am an organizer of the Italy CI Camp).</p>
		<p>It's a bit as make the journey from the start, knowing the path but taking a different luggage with you; and always hoping to bump into/against something interesting. <br>I see contact dance as the best way I have in this lifetime to meet someone outside the social contract and to keep my drive for movement alive. <br>Life is movement, moving in pairs accelerates awareness. <br>I deeply believe that contact improvisation is potentially, a big, healthy revolution.</p>
