	<p>Dancer, performer, CI teacher, massagist, visceral therapeut, massage teacher, photographer. Starting from childhood, studied acrobatics and sport gymnastics. Before starting CI, worked as fitness instructor.
		<p>
			My profession, as a massagist and therapeut, gives me deep understanding of body mechanics and functioning. Which deeply connects with CI practice and gives a lot of information on how we move and interact with each other. At the same time, CI enables me to hear and feel more about human organism, on all the levels - and then the work with human body transforms for me into dance.</p>
