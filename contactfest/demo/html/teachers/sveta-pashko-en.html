	<p>From the forms we will try to come to the understanding of the CI principles. Using the principles we will build the forms. "Do less" - is one of the focuses for the classes. Doing less with the body. Doing less with the mind. It's about honest bodily response that occurs in the movement, in dance, in space.</p>
