	<h3>The Common Body</h3>
	<h5>Level: intermediate</h5>
	“The Common Body” ​is a workshop-laboratory and movement language that is aiming to enrich within dancers the experience in dancing with a partner. Olivia &amp; Yochai are exploring and mixing contact improvisation, dynamic floor work and contemporary partnering, finding a unique vocabulary between real time communication and form. Their unique approach triggers the dancer/mover’s mind to become sharper yet playful and curious. Releasing a wide spectrum of acrobatic possibilities in his own body/movement and with a partner.
