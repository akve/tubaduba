	<h3>"Dancing in the Woods"</h3><br> 
	
	<p>What will happen if we have enough courage to leave the studio for a while to take a small journey? Trails and trees, sky and leaves, drops and whispers may give us an inspiration for turning every moment into dancing in between reality and dreams, consciousness and unconsciousness, present and archetypes. What if we bring this quality of being-dancing to the studio? We'll see what happens. Of course, any plan is just a base for an improvisation.</p>

		<p><b>Bio:</b></p>
		
		<p>Teacher of CI and body intelligence, business trainer.</p>
		<p>Until 2004 I studied/taught/worked in the field of artificial intelligence (MSc degree) ignoring the body in conformity with the Descarte's error. Then I started to study psychology and conduct communicative business trainings since 2005. After a while then my curiosity in tai chi, aikido and meditation led me to contact improvisation in 2008. Since that I have been committed to CI as a regular integrative practice, dancing weekly and even daily for certain weeks and months.</p>
		<p>Since 2015 I am one of organizers and teachers of the international CI festival in Ukraine. I like to play and explore combining CI with tai chi and other bodymind approaches, such as somatics, ideokinesis, bodynamics, osteopathy, authentic movement.</p>
		<p>Teachers who strongly impacted my style of dancing and teaching: Nita Little, Adrian Russi, Mirva Makinen, Eckhard Muller, Arye Bursztyn, Ray Chung, Angelika Dony.</p>
