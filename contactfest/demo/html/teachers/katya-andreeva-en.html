	<h3>"Structure and Flow"</h3><br>
	
	<p>I propose to go deeper into technique. Search for structures that enable the flow of actions. To explore how to create situations, when the body starts to make decisions. To find yourself in movement, noticing own wishes. And noticing breating: your own, your partner's and shared one. Pay attention to sharing and interchange between me and partner, between body experience and spontaneous movement.</p>
