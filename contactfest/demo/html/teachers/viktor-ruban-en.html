	<h3>Seeing through</h3><br>
	
	<p>To see wider perspective, to mix and not to be certain, to risk and to review own limitations. Be honest with yourself and what you do - be it a private talk, dancing space, or performing for the audience... That's what I enjoy noticing in myself and in other people. And that's what we'll do on this class.</p>
